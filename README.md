Hi I'm Kerry!

👨‍🎓 I'm a 4th year CS Specialist at UofT.\
💼 Just finished an awesome 8 month work term at [Moves Financial](https://movesfinancial.com/). \
💪 I've done full-stack web and mobile development at two different companies now with a surprising amount of project mangagement for an intern. Frontend, backend, and project organization are my strong suits!\
\
Cheers~
